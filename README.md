## Searchbar
The searchbar in Toun III lets you bypass mouse interactoins and brings multiple apps and search engines straight to your homepage.

### Quick launch
Type `.` and the name of your listed app or bookmark to go to that bookmark

This is powered by a fuzzy search algorithm, so users don't need to type the entire name of the app or bookmark to access it

`.portainer`, `.port`, and even horrible mispellings like `.porinwendr` will take you to portainer

### Prefixes
Typing one of the following prefixes will launch a search for the rest of the string

| Prefix | Search engine |
| --- | --- |
| No prefix | Google |
| `.d` | DuckDuckGo |
| `.s` | Spotify |
| `.t` | Twitter |
| `.g` | Google |
| `.y` | YouTube |
| `.w` | Wikipedia |
| `.i` | Instagram |
| `.f` | Facebook |
| `.n` | Netflix |
